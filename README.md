## Overview of the analysis:

### Purpose 
The purpose of this analysis is to help Dana, a data journalist create a website to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, there will be table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

## Results:

There is a description of how to perform a search, with images. (4 pt)
To perform a search on this website, you will need the following information. The date, city, state, country, and shape of the UFO. After gathering all of the data, input this into the designated filters and press enter after doing so. This will filter out the search for your results. To clear out and restart, go to the upper left corner and click on UFO Sightings.



## Summary:

A drawback of this webpage would be there is a limited data set, if on were to want to know more in the past there will be no data to support.
Some reccomendation for further developement would be a larger data set and hover over data for my information or a button to submit all filters.
